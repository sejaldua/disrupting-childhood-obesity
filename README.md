# Tufts Vizathon: Disrupting Childhood Obesity

Follow progress at: [sevans09.github.io/Vizathon](http://sevans09.github.io/Vizathon)

#### To Do
    * Add data from Dataset 3 to dropdown
    * Slider does not update bubbles
    * Cite sources used from Covid viz (income, population, etc.)
    * Fix legend domain - need to hard code min/max and fix percents
    * Fix legend domain - hover over and show corresponding counties
    * Fix hovering over a bubble or county outlines the corresponding one in bubble or map
    * Do citations and create video to submit

#### Goals
    * Interactive web application
    * Geographic and time-series data
    * Highlight disparities in health outcomes along socio-demographic segments

#### Data
1. Nutrition, Physical Activity, and Obesity - Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System 
    * Data is from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System, YBRSS, on high school age students in the 50 states and DC. The goal of YBRSS is to determine the presence of health behaviors, assess whether these behaviors increase or decrease over time, and the cooccurrence of health behaviors. Includes data on adolescent diet, physical activity, and weight status.


#### Ideas 
    * Use income data combined with food environment atlas to examine how far different 
      socioeconomic groups travel for grocery stores (by county)
    * Chloropleth map displaying data with a dropdown to choose to display activity 
      levels, diet, weight, and more (by county)
    * Tracking healthy vs. unhealthy behaviors over several years (using youth risk behavior 
    survey); user could maybe sort by state
    â€¢ Visualizing corr between obesity and other variables (income, eudcation, fast food availability, etc.) accross the country by overlaying different colored maps at 50% opacity so they blend
